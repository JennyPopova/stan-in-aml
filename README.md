# Running STAN MPI on Azure Machine Learning compute

This example is based on the [Stan MPI Threading repo by Guido Biele](https://github.com/gbiele/Stan_MPI_Threading).

To run this, we created an IntelMPI based container (based on our [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)) and pushed in to an Azure Container Registry.
